# About

This site is both a blog, and a traversible digital mind (or at least I intend it to be). For more info on what that means, check out [this](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/) overview. For more info on how this one is structured, visit the [GitHub](https://github.com/harttraveller/digital-mind) repository for the site.

## Pages

Note that each page is subject to change as I update my model of reality.

## Site Navigation

[[tags|Blue links]] flip to pages. [Red links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0) open new tabs. The site can be traversed like a non-linear book. Clicking the red `x` in the bottom left corner of a page will close that page. The table of contents on the right lists the headings in a page, and above that is a search bar that indexes page titles and headers. Finally at the bottom you will find the pages that link to the page you are currently on.

## Tools

I used [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) on my local machine, and their [publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) service for the site.

## Header Art

The header art is created with [midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) in the style of [moebius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud). For the most part the page title is used as the prompt.

## Reasoning

The reason I'm intending to merge the two concepts is attributable to redundancy. When writing there is often repetitive information one must cover multiple times for different articles in order to give any new readers contextual understanding. To address this I was initially planning to use obsidian to write "graph blogs" made of atomic concepts, but I suspect this would be unintuitive to most readers. Thankfully, the solution to this problem simply involves embedding notes within other notes; a recently added feature.
