# About

This site is both a blog, and a traversible digital mind (or at least I intend it to be). If you want to know more about what the means, check out [this](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/) overview.

## Tools

I used [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) on my local machine, and their [publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) service for the site. The site files are backed up in this [GitHub](https://github.com/harttraveller/digital-mind) repository.

## Reasoning

The reason I'm intending to merge the two concepts can be attributed to redundancy. When writing blog posts, often there is repetitive information one must cover yet again, to give any new readers contextual understanding. Initially I was planning to use obsidian to write "graph blogs" that had no predefined linear structure, but I suspect this would be unintuitive to most readers. Thankfully, the solution to this problem simply involves embedding notes within other notes; a recently added feature.

## Site Navigation

[[home|Blue links]] flip to pages. [Red links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0) open new tabs. There are lots of other cool features, but I'll leave it up to you to find them.
 
## Header Art

The header art is created with [midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) in the style of [moebius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud). For the most part the page title is used as the prompt.
