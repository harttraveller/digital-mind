# About

This site is both a blog, and a traversible digital mind (or at least I intend it to be). If you want to know more about what the means, check out [this](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/) overview.

## Reasoning

The reason I'm intending to merge the two concepts is attributable to redundancy. When writing there is often repetitive information one must cover multiple times for different articles in order to give any new readers contextual understanding. Initially I was planning to use obsidian to write "graph blogs" made of atomic concepts, but I suspect this would be unintuitive to most readers. Thankfully, the solution to this problem simply involves embedding notes within other notes; a recently added feature.

## Site Navigation

[[home|Blue links]] flip to pages. [Red links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0) open new tabs. The site can be traversed like a non-linear book. Clicking the red `x` in the bottom left corner of a page will close that page. The table of contents on the right lists the headings in a page, and above that is a search bar that indexes page titles and headers. There are lots of other cool features, but I'll leave it up to you to find them.

## Tools

I used [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) on my local machine, and their [publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) service for the site. The site files are backed up in this [GitHub](https://github.com/harttraveller/digital-mind) repository.

## Header Art

The header art is created with [midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) in the style of [moebius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud). For the most part the page title is used as the prompt.
