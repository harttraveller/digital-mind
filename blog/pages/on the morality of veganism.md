- Bob is a the CEO of a meat packing corporation and almost exclusively eats steak.
- Carl is an omnivorous historian and professor at an ivy league university.
- Derek recently read "Sapiens" and watches way too much Rick and Morty.
- Elle is a vegan environmental activist who works at a petting zoo.
- Faith is a religious scholar and data scientist.
- Gary is an avid hunter, outdoorsman, and amateur philosopher.

## conversation
### Alice 

I'll establish context for my view by appealing to mathematics, specifically the [[Wikipedia page - Borsuk-Ulam theorem|Borsuk-Ulam theorem]]. One of its interesting consequences is that [[VSauce - Fixed Points#Borsuk-Ulam Explanation|there must always be two antipodal points on the surface of the Earth with the exact same temperature and pressure]]. 

*...Bob and Carl watch the Vsauce clip...*

With that in mind, I am now going to make a controversial argument. Namely, that we can mathematically prove, much like with the Borsuk-Ulam theory, that our current factory farming practices are ethically equivalent to the mass murder of countless human children each year.


Alice point - borsuk ulam

### Bob 

it's the way things have always been
- we're human

### Carl 

rebuttal to alice
- many dimensions
rebuttal to bob
- just because this has the way it has always been, does not mean it is the way it always has to be

### Alice 

responds with point about the young girl chained to her bed who never cognitively developed.

### Bob 

The point you're making is a slippery ethical slope. If you seriously think that subjective experience and intelligence are all that determines the worth of living being, then couldn't your exact argument be used to argue that we should kill the mentally disabled.

### Alice 

But my point is *not* that we should kill the mentally disabled - the opposite in fact! We should be 

### Derek 

Well how would evolution take place then? [Conflict is a mechanism life uses to bootstrap evolution] and if we try and control nature in order to impose an order determined by 

### Derek 

What you all don't understand is that morality is just a human construction. It's a thing that humans use because it's adaptive. 

### Carl

But we can will it into existence, if we believe in something, it is true by nature of our belief.

### Alice

Also, let's consider a longtermist view. 


### Bob

The greatest crimes are committed by the people with the biggest visions of what the future could be. Longtermism sounds like it could be dangerous if you ever determine that killing a billion people now will let a quintillion people live in paradise a thousand years from now.

## Derek

Hot take: that math checks out, in a utilitarian sense.

## Carl

there need to be lines in the sand we cannot cross

## Alice

And besides, we can't know the future with absolute certainty. You're virtually never going to be assured a trade off like that.

## Bob

Trade off? You people disgust me.

## Alice

Be that as it may, we've diverged from the core topic somewhat. Remember, we're trying to debate veganism.

## Elle

Have you watched dominion? I have dreams...

## Derek

You need to desensitize yourself to operate effectively in a utilitarian sense.

## Faith

Our goal should be to free the world from the dynamic of conflict, humans can be the the first to do that! We can drive evolution forward via intelligent design instead of brute force conflict.

## Gary

Have you read [the world of edena]? The entire story revolves around the idea of humans trying to control nature, excessively imposing order where there was already a stable balance. 

## Alice

Sure Gary, but what happens when a gamma ray burst hits earth, or an asteroid, or the sun simply expands and boils off the oceans?

## Faith

Or the trisolarians arrive...

## Alice

We need to impose order to mitigate existential risk. The entire future is at stake here, and if we can get this right then as Faith stated...
